0.6.0
-----
Enhancements:
* Added Get-CSInstalledAppCompatShimDatabase
* Added Get-CSBitlockerKeyProtector
* Get-CSWmiPersistence now also detects persistence in the root/default namespace.
* Added Get-CSDeviceGuardStatus
* Added positional parameters for Name parameters for Get-CSEventLogEntry, Get-CSService, Get-CSProcess, Get-CSEnvironmentVariable, and Get-CSWmiNamespace.

Removed:
* Removed the -NoProgressBar parameter from all functions since this is what $ProgressPreference is for.
* Removed Set-DefaultDisplayProperty helper function and all calls to it. It was creating unnecessary code complexity.
* Removed -OperationTimeoutSec param from all functions. Was creating unnecessary code complexity.

General changes:
* Reorganized the folder structure and removed any offensive code.
* A decision was also made that CimSweep will only ever have Get- functions. Considering CimSweep is designed to pull information at scale, it should never perform any action that would change system state.
* Applied PSScriptAnalyzer rules to test code and addressed its findings.

0.5.1
-----
Enhancements:
* Added Get-CSAVInfo (written by @xorrior)
* Added Get-CSProxyConfig (written by @xorrior)
* Added module-wide Pester tests to ensure consistency across functions.

Removed:
* Removed the -Path parameter from Get-CSRegistryKey and Get-CSRegistryValue. -Hive should be used.

0.5.0
-----
Enhancements:
* Added Get-CSWmiNamespace
* Added Get-CSVulnerableServicePermission
* -IncludeACL added to Get-CSRegistryKey, Get-CSDirectoryListing, Get-CSService, and Get-CSWmiNamespace.
* -IncludeFileInfo added to Get-CSService. The file info returned also includes the file ACL.
* Functions that accept exact datetimes now mask off milliseconds to enable more flexible time-based sweeps with second granularity.
* Added optional -UserModeServices and -Drivers switches to Get-CSService. This is helpful if you only want drivers or only want user-mode services.

Removed:
* Dropped -Drivers and -Services from Get-CSRegistryAutoStart. Get-CSService is the ideal means of obtaining service and driver information.

0.4.1
-----
* Bigfix: Forgot to rename Set-DefaultDisplayProperty in Get-CSRegistryAutoStart.
* Enhancement: Addressed PSScriptAnalyzer warnings

0.4.0
-----
* Compatible PS Editions: Desktop, Core (i.e. Nano Server and Win 10 IoT)
* -IncludeAcl switch added to Get-CSRegistryKey and Get-CSDirectoryListing. Appending this argument will add an ACL parameter to each object returned.
* The output types of all functions are now fully and properly documented.
